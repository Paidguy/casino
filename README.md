# SattaKing.IND Pro | Behavioral Gambling Simulator 🏺🎰

**The House Always Wins. We'll show you the math.**

## ⚠️ MANDATORY DISCLAIMER
**THIS IS A MATHEMATICAL SIMULATION.**
- **NO REAL MONEY** is involved (Virtual ₹ Currency only).
- **NO DEPOSITS** are processed; all "Add Balance" functions are local simulations.
- **EDUCATIONAL USE ONLY:** Designed to demonstrate the mathematics of gambling losses and the psychological "dark patterns" used in modern Satta and Crypto-Casino platforms.

## 🎯 The Philosophy
SattaKing.IND Pro is a **Glass Casino**. It provides the high-octane, dopamine-heavy experience of Bharat's most popular Satta Matka and global casino suites, but with a fully exposed backend. It is a behavioral-economics experiment designed to help users understand why the "Punter" can never beat the "Bookie" in the long run.

## 🎲 The Professional Suite

### 🏺 Satta & Table Games
1.  **Matka Draw:** High-fidelity Satta simulation with single-ank and patti logic.
2.  **Teen Patti:** 3-card poker with 52.5% Dealer Bias (Standard House Edge).
3.  **Baccarat:** Live-style table game with Player, Banker, and Tie logic.
4.  **Wheel of Fortune:** Multiplier-based rotation with 10.0x jackpot segments.
5.  **Keno:** 40-ball lottery synchronizer with multi-hit scaling.

### ✈️ Modern Crypto-Games
1.  **Aviator (Crash):** Exponential curve growth with a 1% instant-bust mathematical trap.
2.  **Mines:** Combinatorial risk assessment on a 5x5 grid.
3.  **Plinko:** 16-row normal distribution simulator (1000x High-Risk mode).
4.  **Slots:** High-variance volatility with "near-miss" visual algorithms.

## 🛠️ Technical Architecture

### 1. Deterministic Fairness (HMAC-SHA256)
Every outcome is generated using a **Client Seed**, **Server Seed**, and **Nonce**. This ensures the platform cannot change an outcome after a bet is placed. However, as the platform demonstrates, "Fair Randomness" does not equal "Winning Chance"—the House Edge is built into the payout ratios themselves.

### 2. Audio-Dopamine Synthesis
We do not use mp3 files. All sound effects (wins, spins, losses) are synthesized in real-time using the **Web Audio API**. 
- **Rising Shephard Tones:** Used in Crash to create a psychological sense of urgency.
- **Harmonic Major Chords:** Frequency-shifted to trigger dopamine release during wins.
- **Sub-bass Sawtooth Tones:** Used during losses to simulate a "physical" sense of disappointment.

### 3. The Pit Boss Command (Admin Panel)
Unlock the **Admin Panel** to see the casino's perspective.
- **RTP Control:** Adjust the Global Return to Player (e.g., set to 95% to see balance decay).
- **Edge Overrides:** See the exact mathematical tax on every game module.
- **Global Profit Tracking:** Monitor how much "Virtual ₹" the house has collected from the simulation.

## 🚀 Stack
- **Framework:** React 19 (ESM)
- **State Management:** Persistent `SimulationEngine` via LocalStorage
- **Data Visualization:** Recharts (Live Performance Graphing)
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS (Optimized for 100dvh mobile-first usage)
- **Audio:** Native Browser AudioContext (No external assets)
